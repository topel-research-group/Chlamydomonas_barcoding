# Assembly of some samples

A few samples seem to show heterozygous sites, despite being a haploid; some also seem identical to one another...!
* Assemble these samples to ensure the predictions are accurate

Samples to assemble:
* mt-
  * CC-2342 - heterozygous!?
  * CC-3059 - heterozygous!?

* mt+
  * CC-2936 - identical to CC-3065!?
  * CC-3065 - identical to CC-2936!?
  * CC-2937 - heterozygous!?
  * CC-3086 - heterozygous!?
  * CC-2344 - low coverage...
