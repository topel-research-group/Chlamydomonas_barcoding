# Running the Bamboozle barcoding pipeline

Note: Sample CC-2932 is currently absent from all analyses due to difficulties in obtaining the read data

1. Run with a 500 bp window
  * No windows found...

2. Run with a shorter window (300? 250?)
  * No 500 bp windows found, so no shorter windows will exist...

3. Run per-mating type (+/-) if the above don't turn up anything useable,
   as the study may end up using only mixtures of the same mating type
   due to potential complications introduced by sexual reproduction
