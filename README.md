# Applying Bamboozle to _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_ strains to obtain strain-specific barcodes

1. Running the Bamboozle pipeline on GATK variant calls of the _Chlamydomonas_ strains mapped to the reference genome *scaffolded chromosomes* yielded no results

2. Running the Bamboozle pipeline on the scaffolds, dividing the analysis between mating type + and mating type - strains, also yielded no results

3. Running the Bamboozle pipeline on GATK variant calls of the _Chlamydomonas_ strains mapped to the reference genome *contigs* yielded no results

4. Running the Bamboozle pipeline on the contigs, dividing the analysis between mating type + and mating type - strains, [finally yielded some results](03b_barcoding_contigs/README.md)!
